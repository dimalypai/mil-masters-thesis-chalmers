* Python, C#, F# and Haskell inspired syntax: almost no curly braces, indentation based
* Special modifiers: pure
* Functional features: first-class functions, currying, tuple data type etc.
* Expressions-based approach
* Explicit approach to mutability:
    + <- for assignment
    + let with = for name binding
    + reference types for mutable variables?
    + maybe even some modifiers for mutable variables (not very nice, I think)
* Subtyping but with no downcasts?
* Think about exceptions (using subtyping)
* We can easily have anonymous datatypes created on the fly if we have records in MIL (or maybe just compile them to tuples)
    + record subtyping?
* Explicit nullability (Maybe/Option) for both value and reference types (in C# lingo)
