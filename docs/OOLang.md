Python and Haskell inspired syntax: almost no curly braces, indentation based
Special modifiers: pure
Functional features: first-class functions, currying, tuple data type etc.
Expressions-based approach
Explicit approach to mutability: <- for assignment, maybe even some modifiers for mutable variables and let with = for name binding, reference types?
