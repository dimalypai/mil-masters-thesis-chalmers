# Optimisations
\label{chap:opt}

The vast majority of modern compilers have very sophisticated optimisers to
produce as good code as possible. This can mean quite different things, for
example, low memory consumption, speed (low CPU consumption) or low energy
consumption.

## Monad laws

* General introduction
* Implementation (code snippets)
* Examples (diffs of programs)

## Effect-dependent transformations
