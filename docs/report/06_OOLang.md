# Object-oriented programming language (OOLang)

## Overview

Inspiration, design philosophy

* Haskell, C# and Ruby

## OOLang by example

* Purity
* Mutability
* References
* Maybe
* Classes

## Type system highlights

* Purity
* Subtyping
* Mutability
* Maybe

## Code generation

* General outline
    + Monads
    + Type conversions
* Examples
    + Pure functions
    + Impure functions
    + Classes \cite{TAPL}
* Problems

## Conclusions

* Introduced tuples with subtyping to the MIL
* Rather complex type system increases the complexity of getting the
  type-correct MIL
