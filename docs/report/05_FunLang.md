# Functional programming language (FunLang)

This chapter introduces the first of the two source programming languages which
have been designed.

## Overview

Inspiration for the design (Haskell), main principles.

## FunLang by example

* Data types
* Function definitions
* Polymorphism
* Pattern matching
* Monads (do-blocks)
* throw-catch

## Type system highlights

* System F
* Monads
* Exceptions

## Code generation

* General outline
    + Monads
    + Type conversions
* Examples
    + Simple expressions
    + do-blocks (IO)
    + State
    + Exceptions
* Problems

## Conclusions

* Rather straight-forward code generation, because FunLang and MIL are rather
  close to each other.
