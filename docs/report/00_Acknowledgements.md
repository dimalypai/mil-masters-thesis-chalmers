# Acknowledgements

I owe a big thanks to the Swedish Institute, who made my studies in Sweden
possible, effectively helping me to make one of the biggest changes in my life.

I am really grateful to my supervisor Josef for the initial idea of this
thesis, for all his guidance along the way, for challenging me to always make
this work better.

I would like to thank many of my friends and colleagues for their general
support and for their help with finding an opponent. I am very thankful to
Henrik Edstr√∂m for doing the opposition.

And last but not least, I would like to thank my wife Liza, who believes in me
much more than I do.
